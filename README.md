# ForageSim
----Foraging Simulator game written in Python.----
This is ForageSim, a game where you live in a forest and get to FORAGE things!

You can also CREATE items with the things you find!

Befriend the FOREST SPIRITS, take care of a pet cat, and do tasks for the TOWNSPEOPLE!

Multiple possible endings!


# About this version
ForageSim is currently in Alpha! There may be bugs or crashes. Bug reports can be found in a file called "exceptions.log", which will generate in the same path you put your .exe.

Please report any and all bugs you find, as well as suggestions, comments, or concerns, to alexneely8@gmail.com. 

Thanks for helping ForageSim improve!


# How to Play
Run the .exe file.

You do not need to have Python installed on your system.


# Won't run?
1. Make sure you're on Windows 10.

2. Try making sure your antivirus isn't blocking it. Sometimes applications compiled with pyinstaller may be flagged by some antivirus as false positive.

3. Try opening a command prompt in the path and typing .\forage.exe

4. Still won't run? Send me a bug report.
